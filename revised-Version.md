Transforming complex business challenges into elegant technical solutions—that’s what drives me every day.

With 20+ years in software development and 12+ specializing in Salesforce architecture, I’ve evolved from building enterprise applications at global financial institutions to leading high-performing teams delivering AI-powered solutions. As Director of Global Salesforce at Slalom, I architect cloud ecosystems that don’t just meet today’s requirements—they anticipate tomorrow’s possibilities.

### What defines my approach
I believe great technology serves people, not the other way around. Whether I’m designing multi-cloud integrations or mentoring emerging architects, I focus on solutions that are both technically sophisticated and genuinely useful. Recent work includes AI-assisted data migration frameworks that cut manual effort by ~70% while improving quality—proof that innovation and pragmatism aren’t mutually exclusive.

### Building teams, not just solutions
Leadership, for me, isn’t about having all the answers—it’s about empowering others to find them. My leadership journey began at Groundswell (starting with 2 co-op students), and it unlocked a passion for building and growing people through trust and respect.

At Slalom, I’ve helped grow the Western Canada Salesforce practice from the ground up. I’ve conducted 100+ interviews to recruit the right talent, built exceptional teams, and created opportunities for developers to evolve into architects—while building a culture where people feel safe to take risks and stretch into new roles.

### The AI chapter
In 2024–25 I chose immersion. I built AI-assisted data migration frameworks, helped scale practice-level AI adoption, and earned Agentforce certifications early. My GitHub reflects the builder mindset: 70+ repositories spanning Claude integrations, custom agents, Next.js applications, and experiments with tools like Cursor and Supabase.

### Let’s connect
If you’re navigating complex Salesforce implementations, AI integrations, or building teams that balance technical excellence with human development, I’d love to connect.
