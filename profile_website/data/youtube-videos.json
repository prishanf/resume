      "summary": "## Test\nDavid Allen, a management consultant and executive coach, discusses his \"natural planning model\" in this TEDxAmsterdam talk. He invites the audience to actively participate by taking notes on a current project or situation that is occupying their attention.\n\nAllen highlights that the brain is a natural planning machine, constantly strategizing for survival and achieving goals. He introduces a five-phase natural planning model that takes any impulse into reality:\n\n* Purpose: Identifying the main reason or primary purpose behind a project or event.\n* Vision: Creating a clear vision of success and the ideal outcome.\n* Brainstorming: Generating all potentially relevant ideas to bridge the gap between current reality and the desired vision.\n* Organizing: Structuring and prioritizing the brainstormed ideas based on sequences, critical components, or priorities.\n* Next Action: Defining the very next physical, visible action needed to move the project forward.\n\nAllen contrasts this natural model with what he calls the \"unnatural planning model,\" which often starts by asking for \"good ideas\" without first defining purpose, vision, or generating comprehensive data. This leads to resistance, lack of clarity, and last-minute crises. He also touches upon the \"reactive planning model,\" where people try to solve problems by working harder, reorganizing, or seeking external consultants without a clear plan.\n\nHe attributes the resistance to planning to the fear of being out of control and making mistakes, often stemming from early education experiences that emphasized rigid outlining before creative thought. Allen concludes by reassuring the audience that they are natural planners and can take control of any situation by embracing this inherent ability.",
