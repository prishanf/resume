# HELOC vs Fixed Mortgage: A Complete Financial Analysis with Real Numbers

## Summary

This detailed analysis examines whether to convert a $300,000 HELOC balance (at 4.65% variable rate) to a fixed mortgage (at 3.9% for 5 years) or keep the HELOC and make aggressive extra principal payments of $500-$700/month.

### Key Findings:

**Converting to Fixed Mortgage Wins**: Despite paying down less principal, converting $200-$250K to a fixed mortgage saves $7,000-$17,000 over 5 years compared to keeping everything in a HELOC with extra payments.

**Why the Fixed Conversion Wins**:
- 0.75% lower interest rate saves thousands even with slower principal paydown
- Protects against interest rate increases
- Lower monthly payments achieve better financial outcomes
- Provides budget certainty for 5 years

**Optimal Strategy**: Convert $250,000 to fixed mortgage, keep $50,000 in HELOC for flexibility
- Monthly payment: $1,499.58 (vs $1,162.50 HELOC interest-only)
- Interest saved: $12,400 over 5 years
- Principal paid down: $32,624
- Rate protection on 83% of debt

**Surprising Discovery**: HELOC + $700/month extra payments reduces debt by $42,000 (the most) but costs $64,949 in interest. Converting $250K to fixed only reduces debt by $32,624 but costs just $57,350 in interest — a savings of $7,599.

### Who Should Read This:
- HELOC holders considering conversion to fixed mortgage
- Homeowners with variable-rate debt looking to lock in rates
- Anyone comparing aggressive paydown vs rate arbitrage strategies
- Financial planners advising clients on debt optimization

If you're sitting on a $300,000 HELOC balance at 4.65% and wondering whether to convert some (or all) of it to a fixed mortgage at 3.9%, you're facing one of the most important financial decisions of the year. The difference between making the right choice and the wrong one could cost you thousands of dollars.

I recently ran a comprehensive analysis comparing three strategies: keeping everything in the HELOC, converting portions to a fixed mortgage, and making aggressive extra payments on the HELOC. The results surprised me, and they'll likely surprise you too.

**→ [Use the HELOC vs Mortgage Calculator](/tools/heloc-mortgage-calculator) to run your own numbers.**

## The Setup: Understanding Your Options

Let's start with the baseline scenario:
- **Current HELOC Balance**: $300,000
- **HELOC Interest Rate**: 4.65% (variable)
- **Fixed Mortgage Rate Offer**: 3.9% (locked for 5 years)
- **Amortization Period**: 25 years
- **Analysis Timeframe**: 5 years (matching the fixed rate term)

You have three main strategies to consider:

1. **Status Quo**: Keep everything in the HELOC, pay interest only
2. **Conversion Strategy**: Convert part or all to a fixed mortgage
3. **Aggressive Paydown**: Keep in HELOC but make extra principal payments

## Strategy 1: The Conversion Approach

Converting your HELOC to a fixed mortgage locks in a lower rate but increases your monthly payment because you're now paying principal plus interest instead of interest only.

### Monthly Payment Comparison

Here's what your monthly payments look like at different conversion amounts:

| Amount Converted | HELOC Remaining | Monthly Mortgage P&I | Monthly HELOC Interest | Total Monthly Payment |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| $0 (No conversion) | $300,000 | $0 | $1,162.50 | $1,162.50 |
| $50,000 | $250,000 | $261.17 | $968.75 | $1,229.92 |
| $100,000 | $200,000 | $522.33 | $775.00 | $1,297.33 |
| $150,000 | $150,000 | $783.50 | $581.25 | $1,364.75 |
| $200,000 | $100,000 | $1,044.66 | $387.50 | $1,432.16 |
| $250,000 | $50,000 | $1,305.83 | $193.75 | $1,499.58 |
| $300,000 | $0 | $1,566.99 | $0 | $1,566.99 |

**Key Observation**: Each $50,000 you convert increases your monthly payment by about $67-70. This is because you're now paying down principal, not just servicing interest.

### 5-Year Financial Outcomes

The real story emerges when you look at what happens over 5 years:

| Amount Converted | Principal Paid Down | Total Interest Paid | Interest Saved vs HELOC | Remaining Debt |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| $0 | $0 | $69,750 | $0 | $300,000 |
| $150,000 | $19,575 | $62,310 | $7,440 | $280,425 |
| $200,000 | $26,100 | $59,830 | $9,920 | $273,900 |
| $250,000 | $32,624 | $57,350 | $12,400 | $267,376 |
| $300,000 | $39,149 | $54,870 | $14,880 | $260,851 |

**Critical Insight**: Converting the full $300,000 saves you nearly $15,000 in interest over 5 years and reduces your debt by $39,149. But it also increases your monthly payment by $404.49.

## Strategy 2: HELOC with Aggressive Extra Payments

What if you kept everything in the HELOC but committed to making extra principal payments every month? This is where things get interesting.

### Monthly Payment Breakdown

| Extra Payment | Starting Interest | Average Monthly Payment | Total Principal Paid (5yr) | Balance After 5 Years |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| $0 | $1,162.50 | $1,162.50 | $0 | $300,000 |
| $500 | $1,162.50 | $1,605.34 | $30,000 | $270,000 |
| $600 | $1,162.50 | $1,693.91 | $36,000 | $264,000 |
| $700 | $1,162.50 | $1,782.48 | $42,000 | $258,000 |

**Important Note**: The "average" monthly payment decreases slightly over time because as you pay down principal, the interest portion shrinks each month.

### 5-Year Cost Analysis

| Extra Payment | Total Amount Paid | Total Interest Cost | Debt Reduction | Final Balance |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------| 
| $500/month | $96,321 | $66,321 | $30,000 | $270,000 |
| $600/month | $101,635 | $65,635 | $36,000 | $264,000 |
| $700/month | $106,949 | $64,949 | $42,000 | $258,000 |

**Surprising Finding**: Making $700/month in extra payments pays down the most principal ($42,000), but look at the interest cost compared to converting to fixed...

## The Head-to-Head Showdown

Now let's compare strategies with similar monthly payment levels to see which actually wins.

### Matchup 1: ~$1,600/month Budget

| Strategy | Monthly Payment | Total Paid (5yr) | Interest Paid | Principal Paid | Debt Remaining |
|----------|----------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| HELOC + $500 extra | $1,605.34 | $96,321 | $66,321 | $30,000 | $270,000 |
| Convert $200K to Fixed | $1,432.16 | $85,930 | $59,830 | $26,100 | $273,900 |

**Analysis**: 
- HELOC pays down $3,900 MORE in principal
- But costs $6,490 MORE in total interest
- Fixed conversion has LOWER monthly payment ($173 less)
- **Winner**: Fixed conversion saves you $10,391 over 5 years

### Matchup 2: ~$1,750/month Budget

| Strategy | Monthly Payment | Total Paid (5yr) | Interest Paid | Principal Paid | Debt Remaining |
|----------|----------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| HELOC + $700 extra | $1,782.48 | $106,949 | $64,949 | $42,000 | $258,000 |
| Convert $250K to Fixed | $1,499.58 | $89,975 | $57,350 | $32,624 | $267,376 |

**Analysis**:
- HELOC pays down $9,376 MORE in principal
- But costs $7,599 MORE in interest
- Fixed conversion has $283 LOWER monthly payment
- **Winner**: Fixed conversion saves you $16,974 over 5 years

## Why This Happens: The Math Behind the Madness

The results seem counterintuitive at first. How can paying down MORE principal end up costing you MORE money?

### The Interest Rate Differential

The answer lies in the 0.75% gap between the two rates:
- HELOC: 4.65% on entire remaining balance
- Fixed: 3.9% on converted amount

When you keep money in the HELOC and make extra payments, you're still paying 4.65% interest on the full remaining balance every single month. Yes, 100% of your extra payment goes to principal, but you're bleeding interest on a high-rate loan.

When you convert to fixed, you immediately drop the interest rate on that chunk of debt by 0.75%. Even though only about 40% of your payment goes to principal at the start, the compounding effect of the lower rate saves you thousands.

### A Simple Example

**Month 1 with HELOC + $700 extra:**
- Balance: $300,000
- Interest charge: $1,162.50
- Principal payment: $700
- Total paid: $1,862.50
- New balance: $299,300

**Month 1 with $250K converted to fixed:**
- Fixed portion interest: $812.50 (3.9% on $250K)
- HELOC interest: $193.75 (4.65% on $50K)
- Principal payment: ~$493
- Total paid: $1,499.58
- Much less paid, similar principal reduction when you factor in the fixed portion

## The Hidden Risk: Interest Rate Volatility

All of the above analysis assumes the HELOC rate stays at 4.65% for the entire 5 years. But HELOC rates are variable, and here's what happens if rates rise:

### Scenario: HELOC Rate Increases to 5.5%

| Strategy | Original Interest Cost | New Interest Cost | Additional Cost |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Keep all in HELOC | $69,750 | $82,500 | +$12,750 |
| HELOC + $700 extra | $64,949 | $72,188 | +$7,239 |
| Convert $250K to Fixed | $57,350 | $59,894 | +$2,544 |

**Risk Protection**: The fixed conversion protects $250,000 from rate increases. Even a 1% increase costs the HELOC-only strategy an extra $10,000+ over 5 years.

### Scenario: HELOC Rate Decreases to 3.9%

If rates drop to match your fixed offer, the two strategies become roughly equivalent. But ask yourself: is it more likely rates will drop below 3.9% or rise above 4.65% in the next 5 years?

## The Flexibility Factor

There's one major advantage to the HELOC + extra payments strategy: **flexibility**.

**HELOC Advantages:**
- Can reduce or stop extra payments if you face financial hardship
- Can re-borrow paid-down amounts in emergencies (if HELOC allows)
- No commitment to a fixed payment amount

**Fixed Mortgage Advantages:**
- Locked payment provides budgeting certainty
- Protected from rate increases
- Forced discipline (can't skip payments)
- Lower overall cost

**The Hybrid Solution**: Convert $200-250K to fixed to lock in savings and rate protection, but keep $50-100K in the HELOC for flexibility. This gives you the best of both worlds.

## Real-World Recommendations

Based on this comprehensive analysis, here are my recommendations for different situations:

### If You Value Certainty and Savings
**Convert $250,000 to Fixed**
- Monthly payment: $1,499.58
- 5-year savings: $12,400 in interest
- Keep $50K in HELOC for emergencies
- Best overall financial outcome

### If You Want Maximum Flexibility
**Convert $150,000 to Fixed**
- Monthly payment: $1,364.75
- 5-year savings: $7,440 in interest
- Keep $150K in HELOC for maximum access
- Moderate financial benefit with high flexibility

### If You're Aggressive About Debt Payoff
**Convert $200,000 to Fixed + Make Extra Payments**
- Base monthly payment: $1,432.16
- Add extra $300-500/month to mortgage when possible
- Get lower rate benefits PLUS faster paydown
- Best of both strategies combined

### If You Expect Rates to Rise Significantly
**Convert All $300,000 to Fixed**
- Monthly payment: $1,566.99
- Maximum protection from rate increases
- Largest interest savings: $14,880
- Most aggressive debt reduction: $39,149

## The Strategy I'd Choose

If this were my debt, I'd **convert $250,000 to the fixed mortgage** for these reasons:

1. **Significant savings**: $12,400 in interest over 5 years is real money
2. **Rate protection**: 83% of my debt is protected from rate increases
3. **Substantial paydown**: $32,624 in principal reduction
4. **Emergency cushion**: $50K remains accessible in HELOC
5. **Manageable payment**: $1,500/month is $337 more than interest-only, but $67 less than HELOC + $700/month strategy

The $50K I keep in the HELOC gives me breathing room for emergencies without sacrificing the major financial benefits of the conversion.

## Action Steps

If you're considering this decision, here's what to do:

1. **Verify the numbers**: Make sure your 3.9% fixed rate offer is still available and confirm any fees
2. **Check HELOC terms**: Ensure there are no penalties for reducing your HELOC balance
3. **Review your budget**: Calculate the highest monthly payment you can comfortably afford
4. **Consider your risk tolerance**: How worried are you about rates increasing?
5. **Plan for the future**: What happens after 5 years when the fixed rate expires?
6. **Run your own numbers**: Use the tables above to model your specific situation

## The Bottom Line

While the HELOC with extra payments strategy pays down more principal in raw numbers, the fixed mortgage conversion is the clear winner for most people because:

- **Lower total cost**: Save $7,000-$17,000 over 5 years depending on conversion amount
- **Interest rate protection**: Lock in 3.9% while HELOC rates could rise
- **Lower monthly payments**: Get better results with less cash out of pocket
- **Forced discipline**: Automatic principal paydown without relying on willpower

The math is clear: a 0.75% interest rate difference compounds to significant savings, even when you're paying down principal more slowly. Lock in that lower rate while you can.

## Appendix: Calculation Methodology

For those interested in the detailed math:

**Monthly Mortgage Payment Formula**:
```
M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1]
Where:
M = Monthly payment
P = Principal
r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)
n = Total number of payments (years × 12)
```

**HELOC Interest Calculation**:
```
Monthly Interest = Balance × (Annual Rate / 12)
```

**Principal Remaining After N Months**:
```
For each month:
  Interest = Balance × Monthly Rate
  Principal Paid = Payment - Interest
  New Balance = Balance - Principal Paid
```

All calculations assume:
- No fees or closing costs
- Interest compounds monthly
- Fixed rate remains constant for 5 years
- HELOC rate remains at 4.65% (unless otherwise noted)
- Extra payments applied directly to principal
- 25-year amortization for fixed portion
