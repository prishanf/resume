# Canadian Income, RRSP, and Tax Strategies

How is income taxed in Canada? When does an RRSP help—and when should you skip it? How do employment income, capital gains, and preferred vs non-preferred dividends compare for the same dollar amount? This article walks through how Canadian income and tax work, then shows you how to use the **[Canadian Tax Calculator](/tools/canadian-tax-calculator)** to experiment with different income mixes and strategies.

**→ Use the [Canadian Tax Calculator](/tools/canadian-tax-calculator) to run your own numbers, compare scenarios, and see how RRSP and income type change your take-home.**

## How Income Works in Canada

In Canada, your **total income** is the sum of all sources: salary, interest, dividends, capital gains, rental income, and so on. Not all of it is taxed the same way. The CRA treats different income types differently:

- Some are **fully taxable** (e.g. employment, interest).
- Some are **partially taxable** (e.g. only 50% of capital gains is included).
- Some get **special credits** (e.g. eligible and non-eligible dividends have gross-ups and dividend tax credits).

Your **taxable income** is what’s left after:

- Certain deductions (e.g. RRSP contributions, net rental expenses),
- And after applying inclusion rates and gross-ups where applicable.

Tax is then calculated on that taxable amount using **federal and provincial brackets**, and reduced by credits such as:

- Basic personal amount
- Dividend tax credits (federal and provincial)

**Payroll deductions** (CPP and EI) apply only to **employment** (and similar) income—not to investment income like interest, dividends, or capital gains. So for the same total dollars, “how you earn it” changes both your tax and your take-home.

## Benefits of RRSP and When to Use It

### What an RRSP Gives You

- **Tax deduction now:** Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. You get a refund (or lower tax) at your marginal rate.
- **Tax-deferred growth:** Investments inside the RRSP grow without annual tax on interest, dividends, or capital gains until you withdraw.
- **Income splitting (e.g. spousal RRSP):** Can help shift future retirement income to a lower-earning spouse and smooth out tax in retirement.

### When to Use RRSP

Use RRSP when:

- You’re in a **high tax bracket now** and expect to be in a **lower bracket in retirement** (or in a future year). Contributing in high-income years maximizes the value of the deduction.
- You’ve already maxed your TFSA and have RRSP room and cash to save for retirement.

### When Not to Use RRSP (or Prioritize TFSA First)

- You expect to be in a **higher** tax bracket in retirement—RRSP withdrawals will be taxed more heavily; TFSA may be better.
- You need the money **soon** (e.g. before retirement). RRSP withdrawals count as income and can push you into a higher bracket and reduce benefits (e.g. GIS).
- **Low-income years** are often better for TFSA or paying down debt rather than RRSP.
- You’re near **OAS clawback** and RRSP withdrawals would make it worse—sometimes deferring RRSP or drawing down in a planned way is smarter.

The calculator lets you add an RRSP contribution and see how much your taxable income and tax drop, so you can judge whether the “refund” is worth it for your situation.

## Same Income, Different Sources: How Tax and Take-Home Differ

For the same **total dollar amount** of income, your after-tax take-home and effective tax rate depend heavily on the **type** of income. The calculator supports employment, interest, eligible dividends, non-eligible dividends, capital gains, and rental income. Here’s how they differ.

### Employment Income

- **Fully taxable.** Subject to CPP and EI on employment earnings. No special credits.
- Usually the **highest** effective tax + payroll cost for a given dollar amount.

### Capital Gains Income

- Only **50%** of the gain is included in taxable income. No CPP/EI.
- So $10,000 of capital gains is taxed like $5,000 of extra employment income—often a **much lower** tax bill and higher take-home than the same amount as employment income.

### Eligible (Preferred) Dividends

- The amount is “grossed up” (e.g. 38%) for tax calculation, then you get a **federal and provincial dividend tax credit**. The credit is designed so the combined tax reflects corporate tax already paid.
- Result: often the **lowest** effective tax rate for a given dollar of dividend income, especially in middle brackets.

### Non-Eligible (Non-Preferred) Dividends

- Smaller gross-up (e.g. 15%) and **smaller** dividend tax credit than eligible dividends.
- Tax is higher than eligible dividends but often still **lower** than the same amount as employment or interest income.

### Interest Income

- **Fully taxable**, no special credits. No CPP/EI.
- Same tax treatment as “extra salary” for the amount of interest (but without payroll deductions if the interest is from investments).

### Example comparison tables: same total income, different type

The tables below show **take-home**, **total tax + CPP + EI**, and **effective rate** when the same total income is received entirely as one type. All figures are **Ontario, 2025** (as in the [Canadian Tax Calculator](/tools/canadian-tax-calculator)). Notice how employment income is hit hardest (full tax plus CPP/EI), while eligible dividends often have the lowest effective rate.

**$50,000 total income**

| Income type | Take-home | Tax + CPP + EI | Effective rate |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Employment | $39,390 | $10,610 | 21.2% |
| Interest | $42,977 | $7,023 | 14.0% |
| Eligible dividend | $50,000 | $0 | 0.0% |
| Non-eligible dividend | $48,427 | $1,573 | 3.1% |
| Capital gains | $47,864 | $2,136 | 4.3% |

**$75,000 total income**

| Income type | Take-home | Tax + CPP + EI | Effective rate |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Employment | $55,865 | $19,135 | 25.5% |
| Interest | $61,125 | $13,875 | 18.5% |
| Eligible dividend | $74,879 | $121 | 0.2% |
| Non-eligible dividend | $68,459 | $6,541 | 8.7% |
| Capital gains | $70,420 | $4,580 | 6.1% |

**$100,000 total income**

| Income type | Take-home | Tax + CPP + EI | Effective rate |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Employment | $73,205 | $26,795 | 26.8% |
| Interest | $78,713 | $21,287 | 21.3% |
| Eligible dividend | $96,709 | $3,291 | 3.3% |
| Non-eligible dividend | $88,292 | $11,708 | 11.7% |
| Capital gains | $92,977 | $7,023 | 7.0% |

**$150,000 total income**

| Income type | Take-home | Tax + CPP + EI | Effective rate |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Employment | $105,552 | $44,448 | 29.6% |
| Interest | $111,060 | $38,940 | 26.0% |
| Eligible dividend | $138,169 | $11,831 | 7.9% |
| Non-eligible dividend | $123,812 | $26,188 | 17.5% |
| Capital gains | $136,125 | $13,875 | 9.2% |

**$200,000 total income**

| Income type | Take-home | Tax + CPP + EI | Effective rate |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Employment | $135,740 | $64,260 | 32.1% |
| Interest | $141,248 | $58,752 | 29.4% |
| Eligible dividend | $177,392 | $22,608 | 11.3% |
| Non-eligible dividend | $157,158 | $42,842 | 21.4% |
| Capital gains | $178,713 | $21,287 | 10.6% |

At **$50K**, eligible dividends can have almost no tax (dividend credits offset the tax on the grossed-up amount). As income rises, the gap between employment and other types widens: at **$200K**, employment leaves you with about **$42K less** take-home than the same amount as eligible dividends, and about **$43K less** than as capital gains. Use the calculator to try your own province and tax year.

## Income Options Supported in the Calculator

The [Canadian Tax Calculator](/tools/canadian-tax-calculator) lets you enter amounts for each of these sources. They are combined into total income; taxable income is computed using CRA-style rules (gross-ups and inclusion rates); then federal and provincial tax, plus CPP and EI where applicable, are estimated.

| Income type | How it’s treated |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Salary / Employment** | Fully taxable; subject to CPP and EI |
| **Interest income** | Fully taxable; no CPP/EI |
| **Eligible dividends** | Gross-up + federal/provincial dividend tax credit |
| **Non-eligible dividends** | Smaller gross-up and credits |
| **Capital gains** | 50% inclusion in taxable income |
| **Rental income** | Net of **Rental expenses** (only net rental is taxable) |

**Deductions:**

- **RRSP contribution** — reduces taxable income.
- **Rental expenses** — reduce rental income (net rental is included in taxable income).

You can also choose **Tax year** and **Province** (e.g. Ontario, BC, Alberta, Quebec) to see how rates and credits change by jurisdiction and year.

## Using the Tool to Experiment with Income Strategies

You can use the calculator to compare different “mixes” of income without changing total dollars received:

1. **Scenario A:** All income as salary. **Scenario B:** Same total but part as capital gains or dividends. Compare effective rate and after-tax income.
2. **RRSP impact:** In one scenario add an RRSP contribution; in another leave it at zero. See how much taxable income and tax drop.
3. **Provinces:** Same numbers in Ontario vs Alberta vs BC vs Quebec—marginal and effective rates differ.
4. **Dividend vs salary:** If you’re incorporated, see how much more (or less) take-home you get with dividends vs salary for the same gross amount.

Use **+ Add scenario** to build up to three scenarios and switch between them; the **Scenario comparison** table at the bottom shows total income, effective rate, marginal rate, after-tax income, and total tax + payroll side by side.

## Brief User Guide: Calculate Your Own Tax

1. Select **Tax year** and **Province** at the top of the form.
2. Enter your income in the relevant boxes: Salary, Interest, Eligible dividends, Non-eligible dividends, Capital gains, Rental income. Leave others at 0 if not applicable.
3. Enter any **Rental expenses** (they reduce taxable rental income) and **RRSP contribution** (reduces total taxable income).
4. Read your **After-tax take home**, **Effective rate**, and **Marginal rate** in the summary card. Use the breakdown for federal tax, provincial tax, CPP, and EI.
5. To compare options, click **+ Add scenario**, duplicate or change amounts (e.g. more RRSP, or swap salary for dividends), then switch between Scenario A / B (and C) and check the **Scenario comparison** table at the bottom.

These are **estimates** for the selected tax year and province. Always verify with the CRA and a tax professional for your situation.
