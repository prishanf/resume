# Mastering the Salesforce Experience Cloud

Building external-facing portals on the Salesforce platform requires a different mindset than internal app development. Security, performance, and user experience become paramount.

## Architecture for Scale

When designing for Experience Cloud, you must consider the unique challenges of high-volume traffic and complex sharing models.

### Key Considerations:
- **Sharing Sets vs. Sharing Rules**: Understanding when to use high-volume portal sharing for performance.
- **LWC Optimization**: Building lightweight, responsive components that work across all devices.
- **Integration Patterns**: Securely exposing back-office data through APIs and middleware.

## The Importance of UX

A portal is only successful if users actually use it. Strategic alignment between technical architecture and user experience design is what separates a good portal from a great one.
