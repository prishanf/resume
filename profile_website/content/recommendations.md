This was a short but impactful engagement where we delivered a piece of key functionality which we know will be helpful to both Investors Group’s clients and advisors. Your ability to explain to clients in laymens terms how our solution will look like in the future state has been key to obtaining buy in and sign off from our PO’s. Your ability to lead the team in terms of guiding the overall technical design of the file exchange has been instrumental in the dev team’s ability to quickly complete user stories assigned to them.
