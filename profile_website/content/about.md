# About Prishan Fernando

Transforming complex business challenges into elegant technical solutions—that's what drives me every day.

With over 20 years in software development and 12+ years specializing in Salesforce architecture, I've evolved from building enterprise applications at global financial institutions to leading high-performing teams that deliver transformative AI-powered solutions. As Director of Global Salesforce at Slalom, I architect cloud ecosystems that don't just meet today's requirements—they anticipate tomorrow's possibilities.

Currently pioneering AI-powered cloud solutions that drive millions in client impact.

## What Defines My Approach

I believe great technology serves people, not the other way around. Whether I'm designing multi-cloud integrations for enterprise clients or mentoring emerging architects, I focus on creating solutions that are both technically sophisticated and genuinely useful. My recent work pioneering AI-assisted data migration frameworks has cut manual effort by 70% while improving quality—proof that innovation and pragmatism aren't mutually exclusive.

## Technical Excellence Meets Human Impact

My expertise spans the full Salesforce ecosystem—from Sales Cloud and Experience Cloud to cutting-edge Agentforce implementations. But technical skills are just tools. What matters is how we apply them. I've led teams through complex healthcare discoveries, architected multi-brand CRM platforms for global manufacturers, and built reusable accelerators that now drive opportunities across multiple markets. Each project succeeds because we balance architectural rigor with empathy for the people using these systems.

## The Technical Journey

I've always been drawn to challenges others avoid. I led global teams across six time zones to deliver multi-version enterprise applications. When I discovered Salesforce in 2013, I saw something revolutionary—a platform where business logic, user experience, and integration could finally live in harmony. Since then, I've completed 12+ certifications, earned Agentblazer Innovator status, and built solutions spanning every major Salesforce cloud.

But certifications are just checkpoints. The real growth came from projects that transformed fragmented systems into unified customer experiences, where complexity met cloud innovation. Each project taught me something new about balancing technical possibilities with human needs.

## Building Teams, Not Just Solutions

Leadership, for me, isn't about having all the answers—it's about empowering others to find them.

My leadership journey began unexpectedly at Groundswell. Honestly, I didn't think I had leadership skills. But once I became a people leader, it unlocked a hidden passion for building and growing people with trust and respect. I started with 2 co-op students reporting to me, learning as I went. That experience shaped how I approach leadership today.

At Slalom, I've grown the Western Canada Salesforce practice from the ground up—from a handful of consultants to larger teams delivering millions in client value. I've conducted 100+ interviews to recruit the right talent, built exceptional teams, and created opportunities for developers to evolve into architects. But more importantly, we've created a culture where people feel empowered to take risks, try new roles, and push beyond what they thought possible.

My proudest moments aren't about the millions in projects secured; they're about team members who say, "Prishan pushed me to try something I didn't think I could do" or "He makes you feel like a capable equal, not an employee" or "He creates opportunities for growth before you even realize you're ready." That's the leader I aspire to be.

## The AI Chapter

2024-25 marked a turning point. As generative AI exploded, I saw two paths: watch from the sidelines or dive deep. I chose immersion. I built AI-assisted data migration frameworks that cut effort by 70%. Led Slalom's AI Task Team to scale capabilities across our practice. Earned Agentforce certifications before most people knew what agentic systems were. Now I'm architecting solutions where AI doesn't replace humans—it amplifies their potential.

My GitHub tells the story: 70 repositories spanning Claude integrations, custom agents, Next.js applications, and experimental frameworks. Late nights experimenting with Cursor, building proofs-of-concept with Supabase, pushing the boundaries of what's possible when you combine enterprise platforms with cutting-edge AI.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions, you'll find me experimenting with the latest development frameworks (currently deep in Cursor, Next.js, and Supabase), contributing to open-source projects on GitHub, or exploring the principles of servant leadership. I'm also passionate about financial independence and long-term investing—applying the same systems thinking to personal growth that I bring to technical challenges.

My side projects range from personal finance trackers to real estate management accelerators—always building, always learning. I believe the same principles that create great software create great lives: intentional design, continuous improvement, and genuine service to others.
