Deliver Exceptionally:
My commitment to delivering exceptional work has been recognized through various project
achievements. For instance, during the Rockwell Automation project, my contribution to defining the
project's architecture and data model paved the way for a successful completion of the discovery phase.
Additionally, my efforts in leading the Salesforce Avesdo integration team were acknowledged by both
the client and internal team, showcasing the high quality of work delivered.
Throughout the past year, my work primarily revolved around one key delivery/development project,
while the rest of my engagements were discovery projects. This unique mix of project types provided me
with a valuable and diverse set of experiences.
In my role within the discovery projects, I had the opportunity to participate in discovery calls where I
actively listened to our clients, gaining deep insights into their pain points and technology gaps. These
insights were pivotal in understanding the specific needs and challenges that our clients faced. As a
result, I could tailor our solutions and recommendations to align with their business objectives and
address their pain points effectively.
A noteworthy aspect of my role in these projects was that most of the stakeholders were non-technical
individuals. To bridge the gap between the technical aspects of the solutions I was designing and the
stakeholders' understanding, I adopted a communicative approach. I made it a point to provide technical
explanations and recommendations with relevant examples drawn from our client's specific needs and
challenges. By doing so, I ensured that the solutions proposed were not only technically sound but also
easy for non-technical stakeholders to grasp.
This approach contributed to a higher degree of collaboration and alignment between technical teams
and non-technical stakeholders, fostering a more effective decision-making process and ensuring that
the architecture and solutions presented met the client's objectives. It also demonstrated my ability to
communicate complex technical concepts in a manner that resonated with our clients' needs and goals,
ultimately enhancing the success of our projects.
The feedback from Morgan, the project manager on the client side, further reinforces my ability to deliver
impactful results, as the demo I orchestrated was not only well put together but also instilled confidence
in the programs. Likewise, the positive feedback from Lucky, the Client Partner, on the impact of the
demo during the Fraser Health CRM/PRM Discovery project signifies the exceptional delivery of valuable
insights and solutions.

Grow Expertise:
My dedication to personal and professional growth has been evident throughout the year. I have
consistently taken on challenging projects, such as the MSI Quote to Cash (C2Q) project, which required
a deep understanding of the technical intricacies and a continuous learning process. Embracing new
technologies, like B2B Lightning, and effectively applying them to ongoing projects underscore my
commitment to advancing my expertise and ensuring the highest quality of technical implementation. I
made significant strides in my professional development by becoming an expert in Tailwind CSS. This
proficiency has allowed me to create more efficient and visually appealing user interfaces, enhancing the
overall user experience for our clients.
Furthermore, by expanding my skill set to include healthcare capabilities, I have gained a
comprehensive understanding of the distinctive challenges and specific requirements prevalent in the
healthcare sector. This enriched knowledge has empowered me to provide more customized and
impactful solutions to our healthcare clients, establishing our firm as a reliable and proficient partner in
addressing their intricate technological demands.
Additionally, my initiative to facilitate skill expansion among my team members in Omini Studio and
Amazon Connect for Service Cloud has reinforced our collective ability to deliver comprehensive and
integrated customer service solutions.
