# Consulting Panel & Networking Event — Q&A (Prishan Fernando)

Short, concise answers for student-submitted panel questions.

---

## 1. What skills or experiences most helped you succeed in consulting?

**Technical depth plus translation.** Being able to design and deliver (e.g., enterprise architecture, integrations, data migration) gave me credibility. What made the difference was **translating complex technical concepts into clear, actionable options** for non-technical stakeholders. Early experience coordinating **global teams** (e.g., at HSBC across Canada, UK, Hong Kong, US, China, India) taught me how to work across time zones and cultures. **Mentoring and growing people**—and caring that they succeed—built trust with both clients and my own teams.

## 2. What internal roles exist within consulting firms for people who want exposure to the business without being on the client delivery track?

**Practice / capability roles:** building and running a practice area (e.g., hiring, standards, quality, training). **Solution or offering development:** defining reusable assets, accelerators, and methodologies. **Alliance / partner management:** working with vendors and partners. **Talent / people:** recruiting, career development, and culture. **Sales support / pursuit:** shaping proposals and solution design without leading the delivery. **Internal COEs or communities:** e.g., leading an AI or architecture community of practice. These roles give you business exposure, influence, and visibility without being on the front line of client delivery every day.

## 3. What differentiates high-performing consultants from average ones in real client engagements?

**Ownership and follow-through:** they do what they say, and they close the loop. **Clarity under pressure:** they simplify complexity and help the client decide, instead of dumping options. **Stakeholder management:** they read the room, adapt their style, and build trust with both technical and executive audiences. **Pragmatism:** they balance “ideal” with “achievable” and ship value incrementally. **Team multiplier effect:** they make others better (mentoring, knowledge sharing, raising the bar) so the whole engagement performs, not just them.

---

## 4. How do you build credibility quickly with senior stakeholders, especially when entering a new industry or organization?

**Listen first.** Understand their goals, constraints, and language before proposing. **Speak in outcomes, not jargon.** Frame technical choices in terms of risk, cost, speed, and business impact. **Deliver one or two early wins**—even small ones—to show you’re reliable. **Be honest about what you don’t know** and commit to finding out; that builds trust faster than overclaiming. **Align with their priorities** (e.g., governance, roadmap, risk) and show you’ve done the homework. Consistency and follow-through matter more than a big splash in week one.

---

## 5. What experiences or project types accelerate promotion and skill development?

**Large, cross-functional programs** (e.g., M&A integrations, multi-cloud rollouts, global platform deployments) force you to work across teams, vendors, and stakeholders. **Stretch roles** where you own architecture or program outcomes before you feel “ready”—with support. **Practice-building work:** hiring, defining standards, leading communities (e.g., AI or architecture). **Reusable assets and automation:** building accelerators, toolkits, or AI-assisted frameworks that others use; that scales your impact and visibility. **Mentoring and developing others** is often explicitly valued for promotion and teaches you how to lead.

---

## 6. Are there industries or capabilities (e.g., global management, digital, AI, transformation, ESG) that you see growing most in demand?

**AI and intelligent automation** are front and centre—from agentic workflows and copilots to AI-assisted delivery (e.g., migration, testing). **Digital transformation and cloud** (CRM, commerce, experience platforms, integrations) remain strong. **Data and integration** (governance, quality, migration at scale) are perennials. **Global / multi-geography programs** and **M&A integration** continue to drive need for people who can operate across boundaries. **ESG and responsible tech** are rising in importance for many clients. Combining **domain depth with AI/digital** is where I see the most pull.

## 7. What do you look for most in BBA and MBA candidates beyond technical or analytical skills?

**Curiosity and learning agility:** willingness to dive into a new domain or tool and get up to speed. **Communication:** ability to structure a message and adapt it to the audience (executive vs. technical). **Collaboration and humility:** working well in teams, asking for help, and crediting others. **Ownership:** treating commitments seriously and following through. **Judgment:** knowing when to push for “better” vs. when “good enough” is right for the client. **Resilience and adaptability:** staying effective when scope, stakeholders, or priorities change. I also look for **genuine interest in people and outcomes**—not just in the analysis or the slide deck.

---

## 8. Looking back, what do you wish you had known before entering consulting?

That **leadership is a skill you can grow**—I didn’t think I had it until I was given the chance (e.g., leading a small team) and learned by doing. That **saying “I don’t know yet, but I’ll find out”** is stronger than pretending to know. That **building relationships and trust is as important as the deliverable.** That **you don’t have to be the smartest person in the room;** your job is to help the client and the team win. And that **investing in reusable work (assets, automation, AI)** compounds—it’s worth the upfront time.

## 9. What are the key trade-offs between working at a Big 4 firm, a boutique consultancy, and an in-house role within an organization?

**Big 4 / large firm:** Broad exposure, strong brand, structured career paths, and big programs; can feel more process-heavy and less flexibility in how you work. **Boutique:** Often more ownership, closer to decision-makers, and faster feedback loops; may have less brand recognition and fewer formal training or mobility options. **In-house:** Deep immersion in one culture and strategy, more stability and work-life predictability; less variety of problems and clients, and advancement can be more political or slower. Choose based on what you want to optimize for in the next few years: variety and brand, ownership and speed, or depth and stability.
