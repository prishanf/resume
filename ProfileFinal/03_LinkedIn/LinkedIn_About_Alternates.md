## Version 1: Comprehensive Professional Narrative

Transforming complex business challenges into elegant technical solutions—that's what drives me every day.

With over 20 years in software development and 12+ years specializing in Salesforce architecture, I've evolved from building enterprise applications at global financial institutions to leading high-performing teams that deliver transformative AI-powered solutions. As Director of Global Salesforce at Slalom, I architect cloud ecosystems that don't just meet today's requirements—they anticipate tomorrow's possibilities.

**What Defines My Approach:**

I believe great technology serves people, not the other way around. Whether I'm designing multi-cloud integrations for Fortune 500 clients or mentoring emerging architects, I focus on creating solutions that are both technically sophisticated and genuinely useful. My recent work pioneering AI-assisted data migration frameworks has cut manual effort by 70% while improving quality—proof that innovation and pragmatism aren't mutually exclusive.

**Technical Excellence Meets Human Impact:**

My expertise spans the full Salesforce ecosystem—from Sales Cloud and Experience Cloud to cutting-edge Agentforce implementations. But technical skills are just tools. What matters is how we apply them. I've led teams through complex discoveries at Fraser Health, architected multi-brand CRM platforms for Avigilon, and built reusable accelerators that now drive opportunities across multiple markets. Each project succeeds because we balance architectural rigor with empathy for the people using these systems.

**Building Teams, Not Just Solutions:**

Leadership, for me, isn't about having all the answers—it's about empowering others to find them. I've grown Slalom's Western Canada Salesforce practice from the ground up, conducted 100+ interviews to build exceptional teams, and created opportunities for developers to evolve into architects. My proudest moments aren't about the millions in projects secured; they're about team members who say, "Prishan pushed me to try something I didn't think I could do."

**Looking Forward:**

The intersection of generative AI and enterprise platforms is where I'm investing my energy now. Leading Slalom's AI Task Team, I'm building both the technical capabilities and the community of practice that will define the next decade of enterprise solutions. From Agentforce implementations to custom AI-powered accelerators, I'm fascinated by tools that amplify human potential.

**Beyond the Code:**

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions, you'll find me experimenting with the latest development frameworks (currently deep in Cursor, Next.js, and Supabase), contributing to open-source projects on GitHub, or exploring the principles of servant leadership. I'm also passionate about financial independence and long-term investing—applying the same systems thinking to personal growth that I bring to technical challenges.

**Let's Connect:**

Whether you're tackling a complex Salesforce implementation, building AI capabilities, or simply want to discuss how technology can serve people better—I'd love to hear from you. I believe the best solutions emerge from diverse perspectives and genuine collaboration.

Technical excellence is table stakes. What sets great solutions apart is understanding that technology serves people. I balance architectural sophistication with genuine empathy—whether designing agentic workflows for healthcare systems or coaching junior developers through their first architecture review.

**Current Focus:**
- Generative AI integration in enterprise platforms (Agentforce, Claude, custom LLM implementations)
- Building Slalom's national AI IP library and community of practice
- Enterprise architecture for clients navigating digital transformation

**Tech Stack Highlights:**
Salesforce (Sales, Service, Experience Cloud, Agentforce) | AI/ML (Claude, GPT, custom agents) | Modern Web (Next.js, React, Vue, Supabase) | Integration (MuleSoft, Workato, custom APIs) | Cloud (AWS, Firebase, Neon)

## Version 3: Story-Driven & Personal

**From HSBC's Trading Floors to AI-Powered Cloud Solutions—A Journey in Problem-Solving**

Twenty years ago, I was building trade finance platforms for one of the world's largest banks, helping corporate clients manage billions in global transactions. Today, I architect AI-enhanced Salesforce ecosystems that transform how organizations serve their customers. The industries changed, the technologies evolved—but my mission stayed constant: solve complex problems elegantly.

**The Technical Journey:**

I've always been drawn to challenges others avoid. At HSBC, I led global teams across six time zones to deliver multi-version enterprise applications. When I discovered Salesforce in 2013, I saw something revolutionary—a platform where business logic, user experience, and integration could finally live in harmony. Since then, I've completed 12+ certifications, earned Agentblazer Innovator status, and built solutions spanning every major Salesforce cloud.

But certifications are just checkpoints. The real growth came from projects like architecting Avigilon's multi-brand CRM platform, where we transformed fragmented systems into a unified customer experience. Or pioneering Fraser Health's patient relationship management discovery, where healthcare complexity met cloud innovation. Each project taught me something new about balancing technical possibilities with human needs.

**The Leadership Evolution:**

In 2019, I joined Slalom with a mission: build Western Canada's Salesforce practice into something special. Not just any team—a community where technical excellence and personal growth were inseparable. Today, that team has grown from a handful of consultants to 40+ professionals delivering millions in client value. More importantly, we've created a culture where people feel empowered to take risks, try new roles, and push beyond what they thought possible.

The feedback I cherish most: "Prishan makes you feel like a capable equal, not an employee" and "He creates opportunities for growth before you even realize you're ready." That's the leader I aspire to be.

**The AI Chapter:**

2024-25 marked a turning point. As generative AI exploded, I saw two paths: watch from the sidelines or dive deep. I chose immersion. I built AI-assisted data migration frameworks that cut effort by 70%. Led Slalom's AI Task Team to scale capabilities across our practice. Earned Agentforce certifications before most people knew what agentic systems were. Now I'm architecting solutions where AI doesn't replace humans—it amplifies their potential.

My GitHub tells the story: 70 repositories spanning Claude integrations, custom agents, Next.js applications, and experimental frameworks. Late nights experimenting with Cursor, building proofs-of-concept with Supabase, pushing the boundaries of what's possible when you combine enterprise platforms with cutting-edge AI.

**Beyond Work:**

I'm fascinated by servant leadership, long-term investing, and the intersection of technology and human potential. My side projects range from personal finance trackers to real estate management accelerators—always building, always learning. I believe the same principles that create great software create great lives: intentional design, continuous improvement, and genuine service to others.

**What's Next:**

The next decade belongs to organizations that blend human expertise with AI capabilities thoughtfully. I'm here to help build that future—one architecture decision, one empowered team member, one elegant solution at a time.

Let's connect if you're:
- Navigating complex Salesforce implementations or AI integrations
- Building teams that balance technical excellence with human development  
- Exploring how generative AI can transform your business operations
- Simply passionate about technology that serves people better
